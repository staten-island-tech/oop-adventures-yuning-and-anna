print("This is the best RPG game you will play in this period (cause it's the only one :) ). The whole game is about trying to level up from adventure rank F and also not to rage quit the game because of some great devs :) (Yunning not Anna). Anyways the game begins with MC becoming an adventurer but adventures start at rank F, how original. MC is a failure. But, from exploring life and beating monsters, and also getting beat by monsters, the MC can level up and not be a failure(L). ")
